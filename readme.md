## Hello! ##
This is the code for my portfolio website. I built it with the MERN stack. A small MongoDB database holds the info
for my projects and about me section.

## Change log ##
version 2.0.1

1. Updated some CSS settings so that both modals are identically colored. Previously, they were very slightly different colors.

2. Updated resume and 'contact me' modal to be up to date.

3. Changed hero section's description box to have a slightly larger font and a higher font weight to improve readability.
